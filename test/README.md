# JavaScript1 and JavaScript2 Test

At the end of this module you’ll be doing a comprehension test on paper. Why on paper? Fundamental understanding should become intuitive. Only after having learned and mastered a concept deeply will you be able to use it creatively. If you rely too much on others, on Google or your code editor to do your thinking you'll make it very hard to cultivate the habit to think for yourself.

### Concepts

It will be about the most important JavaScript concepts you’ve learned about so far (JavaScript1 and JavaScript2). Here’s a list of all of them:

- Variables (const and let)
- Data types (strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans)
- Conditional statements (if/switch statement)
- Loops
- Regular and arrow functions
- How to use JavaScript to do basic DOM manipulations (add, modify and remove DOM elements)
- Code commenting
- Scope
- Array functions (map and filter)
- Callbacks
- Hoisting

### Purpose of the test

The purpose of this exam is to test your comprehension of JavaScript1 and JavaScript2 concepts.

- The goal for us is to know how solid your knowledge is and if you need any extra assistance throughout the program.
- The goal for you is to test how well enough you master the material so far.

Therefore, **you won’t be graded**. Like the homework you will get feedback and are expected to improve upon your weak points.

### Preparation

Here's general advice on how to optimally prepare:

- Make a list of every concept you currently don’t understand at all.
- Find out 2 things about each concept: (1) how does the basic structure look and (2) what is the most common use case.
- Ask questions through Slack to your teachers and/or your classmates
- Practice coding WITHOUT Google.
- Practice for understanding (why something is the case), NOT just for repetition’s sake (and hoping ‘you will understand it one day’).
- Stay calm, always

### Practical information

- The test will last about an hour
- It will be done on paper so please **bring a pencil and eraser**.
- There will be 4 questions, 2 for each module

Tip: if any of you need additional support, now is the moment to let us know as we can pair you up with someone to answer any questions you may have up until this point.
